# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Unitalk & Bitrix24 integration project. The goal is to ensure the integration functions correctly, meets the defined requirements, and delivers a seamless user experience.

## Test Objectives

* Validate core functionality: 
    * Call initiation and routing
    * Agent status synchronization
    * CRM integration and data storage
    * Call recording
* Ensure data accuracy and consistency between Unitalk and Bitrix24
* Verify error handling and resilience to potential failures
* Assess call quality and latency
* Gather user feedback on usability and effectiveness

## Test Phases

1.  **Unit Testing**
    * Test individual functions and components of the integration code in isolation
    * Use mocking or stubbing techniques to simulate external dependencies (Unitalk and Bitrix24 APIs)

2.  **Integration Testing**
    * Test the end-to-end call flow and interactions between Unitalk and Bitrix24
    * Include test cases for various scenarios, including:
        * Successful calls with different outcomes (answered, no answer, busy, etc.)
        * Call transfers and forwarding
        * Agent status changes (manual and automatic)
        * AMD detection and CRM updates
        * Call recording and data storage
    * Verify caller ID consistency, data accuracy, and error handling

3.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
    * Involve stakeholders (sales team, managers) to test the integration in a realistic environment
    * Gather feedback on usability, functionality and identify any potential issues or improvements

## Sample Test Cases

* **Call Initiation**
    * Test initiating outbound calls from Unitalk to Bitrix24 using different autodialers
    * Verify that the correct Bitrix24 queue is used based on the autodialer ID
    * Confirm that the caller ID displayed to the recipient is the Australian Voximplant number

* **Call Handling in Bitrix24**
    * Test incoming SIP calls from Unitalk being routed to the correct queues
    * Verify that agents can answer calls within Bitrix24 and interact with the caller
    * Confirm that call recordings are initiated and stored correctly in Bitrix24 Drive

* **CRM Integration**
    * Test CRM record updates based on call outcomes and AMD results
    * Verify that the disposition field is updated accurately and triggers the expected lead stage changes
    * Check if additional call data (e.g., queue time, call duration) is captured and stored correctly

* **Agent Status Synchronization**
    * Test both manual and automatic agent status updates
    * Verify that changes in Bitrix24 telephony status (e.g., "On Call") are reflected in Unitalk's agent status
    * Handle potential conflicts or edge cases in status updates

* **Error Handling and Resilience**
    * Simulate various error scenarios (API failures, network issues, invalid data) and ensure the integration handles them gracefully with appropriate retries, logging, and notifications

* **Reporting and Analytics**
    * Test the generation of required reports using Bitrix24's BI builder or external BI tool
    * Validate the accuracy of the reported metrics (productivity, connect time, AHT, disposition outcomes, strike rate)

* **CRM Integration**
    * Test that the `disposition` and `answ_machine_attempts` fields in the lead record are updated accurately based on call outcomes and AMD results from Unitalk
    * Verify that the disposition updates trigger the expected lead stage changes through Bitrix24 automation
    * Check if other call-related data (e.g., queue time, call duration, caller ID, UTM parameters) is captured and stored correctly in Bitrix24 Drive, associated with the corresponding lead

**Additional Considerations**

* **Test Data:** Prepare test data in both Unitalk and Bitrix24 to simulate different call scenarios and outcomes
* **Test Environments:**  Conduct testing in a staging or sandbox environment before deploying to production
* **Performance Testing:** If applicable, perform load or stress testing to evaluate the integration's performance under high call volumes
* **User Feedback:**  Gather feedback from users (agents, managers) during UAT to identify any usability issues or areas for improvement

**Remember to update this `TESTING.md` file with more specific test cases and scenarios as you progress with the development and gain a deeper understanding of the integration's behavior**
