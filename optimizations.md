# Optimizations for Collaboration

This document outlines the agreed-upon optimizations to enhance our collaboration and minimize oversights during the Unitalk & Bitrix24 integration project.

**Communication and Prompts**

* **Clear and Concise Prompts:** 
    * Focus on providing clear and concise prompts, highlighting the specific task or question you need assistance with.
    * Include relevant context from previous discussions or the project documentation.
    * Specify the desired output format (e.g., code snippet, explanation, list of steps).

* **My Side Improvements**
    * I'll strive to maintain a comprehensive understanding of the project's context by actively referencing the documentation in your GitHub repository and our previous discussions
    * I'll double-check all code snippets for completeness and accuracy before providing them
    * I'll be more mindful of formatting and potential truncation issues
    * I'll proactively seek clarification from you if I'm unsure about any aspect of the requirements or encounter any ambiguities

**Development and Code Management**

* **Modular Development and Code Reviews:**
    * Break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps
    * Conduct periodic code reviews within the GitHub repository to identify potential issues, optimizations, or areas for improvement

* **Structured Task Lists:**
    * Create and maintain structured task lists within the README or a separate project management tool to track progress, assign responsibilities, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks

* **Clear Communication Channels:**
    * Utilize this chat interface for most interactions
    * Leverage GitHub issues for specific code reviews, bug tracking, or feature requests

* **Code Style and Conventions**
    * Agree on and adhere to a consistent code style and naming conventions for the project to enhance readability and maintainability

**Additional Optimizations**

* *(We can add more points here as we identify further opportunities for improvement throughout the project)*
