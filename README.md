# Project Outline: Unitalk & Bitrix24 Integration using SIP Trunking

**Project Goals**

* Leverage Unitalk's Predictive Dialer and Answering Machine Detection for efficient outbound calling.
* Display Bitrix24 Voximplant Australian number as the caller ID to recipients.
* Utilize Bitrix24 for call routing, CRM integration, and call recording.
* Minimize latency and ensure a seamless call experience.
* Optimize costs by leveraging Voximplant rates for answered calls.
* Automate answering machine detection to update lead stage/disposition in Bitrix24 CRM.
* Leverage Unitalk's native Bitrix24 integration for additional CRM enhancements.
* Enable agents to manage their Available/Busy status using automatic updates based on Bitrix24 telephony statuses.

* Queue & Agent Assignment Mapping: Utilize an external mapping table stored in Bitrix24 Drive.
* Autodialer Creation: Triggered by new "Initiative" values in Bitrix24, with validation and lookup to prevent duplicates

**Detailed Requirements**

1. **Call Flow**

* Unitalk initiates outbound calls using its predictive dialer.
* Bitrix24 Voximplant number is displayed as the caller ID.
* Unitalk handles AMD.
* Answered calls are transferred to Bitrix24 via SIP trunking.
* Bitrix24 routes calls to available agents based on the associated queue (mapped from the Unitalk autodialer ID using the external mapping table).
* Agents handle calls within Bitrix24.

2. **CRM Integration**

* Unitalk's native Bitrix24 integration is used for basic call logging and contact synchronization.
* Custom integration code handles:
    * Updating lead stage/disposition based on AMD results from Unitalk (using native connector and automation).
    * Capturing and storing call data (duration, agent, outcome) in Bitrix24 Drive for reporting.
    * Potentially additional CRM updates or actions based on specific call events or outcomes.

3. **Call Recording**

* Call recordings are stored in Bitrix24 and associated with the corresponding lead card.

4. **Agent Status Management**

* Agent status is automatically updated based on their telephony status in Bitrix24 (e.g., "On Call").

5. **Reporting and Analytics**

* Utilize Bitrix24's BI builder and the existing dataset/table for disposition outcome reporting.
* Explore Bitrix24's reporting capabilities or consider external BI tool integration for other metrics:
    * Productivity (time spent waiting)
    * Connect (time spent connected to a customer)
    * AHT (average handling time)
    * Strike rate (bookings/appointments per call connect)

6. **Data Storage**

* Utilize Bitrix24 Drive's "Network Drive" for storing:
    * Integration data (logs, call history, etc.)
    * External mapping table for queue and agent assignments

* Evaluate the need for a dedicated database solution if data volume or complexity increases significantly in the future.

**Gaps and Assumptions**

* **Unitalk:**
    * Caller ID in SIP INVITE: Assumed to be supported, will be tested thoroughly
    * Queue time data: Will be retrieved using `/autodialers/calls/get` API
    * Disposition outcome mapping: Will be handled using the native Unitalk-Bitrix24 connector and automation

* **Bitrix24:**
    * Specific telephony statuses for agent status synchronization need to be confirmed with Bitrix24 support
    * Reporting capabilities for specific metrics need further exploration within Bitrix24's BI builder or potential BI tool integration

**Edge Cases and Error Scenarios**

* **Unitalk:**
    * Failed Call Initiation: Retry logic, logging, notifications
    * AMD Misidentification: Fallback mechanisms, human review, agent override
    * Call Transfer Failures: Retry logic, alternative routing, logging, notifications
    * Webhook Delivery Failures: Retry mechanisms, reliable delivery service/queue
    * API Rate Limits or Errors: Rate limiting, backoff strategies, error handling, and notifications

* **Bitrix24:**
    * SIP Connector Issues: Monitoring, alerting, failover mechanisms
    * CRM Update Failures: Retry logic, error logging, notifications
    * Agent Status Conflicts: Conflict resolution logic, clear feedback to agents
    * Call Recording Failures: Logging, investigation, corrective actions
    * Reporting and Analytics Issues: Thorough testing, data validation, error handling

* **General:**

    * Network Issues: Resilient design, buffering/queueing
    * Data Loss or Corruption: Data storage and backup strategies, data validation

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Successful call completion rate meets or exceeds defined targets
* Call quality and latency are within acceptable limits
* Agent productivity improves due to streamlined call handling and CRM integration
* CRM data accuracy, including AMD updates, is maintained
* Reporting and analytics provide the required insights into call center performance
* Users (agents, managers) are satisfied with the overall usability and effectiveness of the integration

**Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability**

* Acknowledges potential challenges and limits liability for damages or losses
* Highlights reliance on third-party platforms and potential impact of future changes
