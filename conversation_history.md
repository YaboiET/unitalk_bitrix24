## Conversation History Summary

### Initial Discussions and Requirements Gathering

* **Project Goals:**
    * Integrate Unitalk's predictive dialer and AMD with Bitrix24 for outbound calling, CRM integration, and reporting.
    * Display Bitrix24 Voximplant Australian number as caller ID.
    * Minimize latency and optimize costs.

* **Integration Approach:**
    * Use SIP trunking for call connection between Unitalk and Bitrix24.
    * Unitalk handles call initiation and AMD.
    * Bitrix24 handles call routing, CRM integration, and recording.
    * Automatic agent status synchronization based on Bitrix24 telephony events.
    * Data storage in Bitrix24 Drive initially.
    * External mapping table for queue and agent assignments.
    * Autodialer creation in Unitalk triggered by new "Initiative" values in Bitrix24.

* **Key Requirements**
    * Call flow, CRM integration details, call recording, agent status management, reporting metrics.

* **Gap Analysis and Clarifications**
    * Confirmed Unitalk's support for caller ID in SIP INVITE (to be tested).
    * Confirmed AMD results are in the `callState` field in Unitalk webhooks.
    * Queue time data will be retrieved using Unitalk's `/autodialers/calls/get` API.
    * Disposition outcome mapping will be handled using the native Unitalk-Bitrix24 connector and Bitrix24 automation.
    * Need to clarify specific Bitrix24 telephony statuses for agent status synchronization.
    * Need to explore Bitrix24's reporting capabilities further.

* **Edge Cases and Error Scenarios**
    * Identified potential issues related to Unitalk (failed call initiation, AMD misidentification, call transfer failures, webhook/API errors).
    * Identified potential issues related to Bitrix24 (SIP connector issues, CRM update failures, agent status conflicts, call recording failures, reporting issues).
    * Identified general concerns (network issues, data loss).
    * Outlined mitigation strategies for each scenario.

### Technology Choices and Development Environment

* Backend: Node.js with Express.js
* Bitrix24:  Bitrix24 D7 REST API
* Unitalk: Standard HTTP request libraries in Node.js
* Data Storage: Bitrix24 Drive
* Project structure and files created
* Core dependencies installed
* Bitrix24 application registered and OAuth 2.0 credentials obtained
* Express.js server set up
* Bitrix24 OAuth 2.0 flow implemented
* Webhook endpoints defined

### API Interactions and Webhook Handling

* `unitalkWebhooks.js` and `bitrix24Webhooks.js`:
    * Basic structure and handlers for key events implemented.
    * `mapCallStateToDisposition` function refined to handle various call states and avoid unnecessary updates for technical issues.
    * Logic for fetching additional call data (including queue time) from Unitalk added to `handleOnCallEnded`.

* `bitrix24Api.js` and `unitalkApi.js`:
    * Core functions implemented (`initiateBitrix24Call`, `getAgentTelephonyStatus`, `isAgentClockedIn`, `updateAgentStatus`, `getAdditionalCallDataFromUnitalk`).
    * Placeholders for other API interactions (e.g., `updateCrmRecord`, `createCrmActivity`, `triggerAutomation`) and error handling.
    * `getQueueIdForAutodialer` function partially implemented (pending queue mapping logic).

* `data.js`:
    * Functions for data storage and retrieval in Bitrix24 Drive implemented (`storeCallAssociation`, `getBitrix24CallData`, `storeCallDetails`, `storeCallRecording`, `storeAgentAssignments`, `getAgentAssignments`).
    * Error handling and retry mechanisms added to these functions.

### Next Steps

* Clarify with Bitrix24 support about telephony statuses for agent synchronization
* Complete implementation of API interactions and data storage functions in `bitrix24Api.js` and `data.js`
* Explore Bitrix24's reporting capabilities and potentially integrate with external BI tools if needed
* Conduct thorough testing and prepare for deployment
