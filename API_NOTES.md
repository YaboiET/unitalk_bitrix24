**Key Features & Considerations:**

* **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 authorization is required for secure access
    * **Obtain Access Token:**
        * Use the OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain an access token, which will be included in the Authorization header of each API request
        * **Example (using Python `requests` library):**
        ```python
        import requests

        client_id = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
        client_secret = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
        auth_code = 'OBTAINED_FROM_BITRIX24_OAUTH_FLOW'

        token_url = '[https://oauth.bitrix.info/oauth/token/](https://oauth.bitrix.info/oauth/token/)'
        data = {
            'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
            'client_id': client_id,
            'client_secret': client_secret,
            'code': auth_code
        }

        response = requests.post(token_url, data=data)
        access_token = response.json()['access_token']
        ```

* **Methods:** REST API methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are available for data manipulation
    * **Constructing Requests:**
        * Use the appropriate HTTP method and endpoint for each API call
        * Include the access token in the Authorization header
        * Pass parameters as query string parameters (for GET requests) or in the request body (for POST/PUT requests)
        * **Example (using Python `requests` library):**
        ```python
        import requests

        api_url = 'https://your_bitrix24_domain/rest/crm.lead.add'
        headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'}
        data = {
            'fields': {
                'TITLE': 'New Lead',
                # ... other lead data
            }
        }

        response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, data=data)
        ```

* **Webhooks:** Enable real-time notifications and event-driven workflows
    * **Registering Webhooks:**
        * Use the `event.bind` method to register webhooks for specific events
        * Specify the event type, handler URL, and optional filtering parameters
    * **Handling Webhooks:**
        * Implement a webhook handler on your server to receive and process incoming webhook notifications
        * Verify the authenticity of webhook requests using the provided signature

* **Batch Operations:** Efficiently process multiple requests
    * **`batch` Method:** Use the `batch` method to send multiple API calls in a single HTTP request, reducing overhead and improving performance
    * **Structure:** The `batch` request body should contain a `halt` flag (to stop on errors or continue) and a `cmd` object with key-value pairs representing the API calls and their parameters

* **Rate Limits:** Adhere to usage limits to ensure fair access
    * **Default Limits:** Bitrix24 typically has a limit of 50 requests per 10 seconds per user
    * **Monitor Headers:** Pay attention to the `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers in API responses to track your usage and avoid hitting the limits
    * **Implement Throttling/Backoff:** If you approach the rate limits, implement mechanisms to throttle your requests or use exponential backoff to retry requests after a delay

* **App Development:** Framework for building custom applications and integrations
    * **Register Your App:** Register your application in the Bitrix24 Marketplace to obtain the necessary credentials (client ID, client secret) for OAuth 2.0 authorization
    * **Utilize SDKs and Libraries:** Consider using available SDKs or libraries (e.g., for Python, PHP, JavaScript) to simplify API interactions and handle authentication, error handling, etc
    * **Follow Best Practices:** Adhere to Bitrix24's app development guidelines and best practices to ensure your integration is secure, reliable, and user-friendly

* **Documentation:**
    * **Comprehensive documentation:** Available at: [https://dev.1c-bitrix.ru/rest_help/](https://dev.1c-bitrix.ru/rest_help/)
    * **D7 API documentation**: Specific to the cloud-hosted version: [https://training.bitrix24.com/rest_help/](https://training.bitrix24.com/rest_help/)
    * **Navigation challenges:** Can be overwhelming due to the platform's vastness. Utilize search and filtering effectively

### Telephony (integration with VoIP providers)

    * Calculate the expected signature using your Unitalk API secret and the request body.
    * Compare the calculated signature with the one provided in the header to verify authenticity.
    * **Example (using Node.js `crypto` module):**

    ```javascript
    const crypto = require('crypto');

    const secret = 'YOUR_UNITALK_API_SECRET';
    const requestBody = '...'; // Raw request body as a string
    const receivedSignature = req.headers['x-unitalk-signature'];

    const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
    hmac.update(requestBody);
    const calculatedSignature = hmac.digest('hex');

    if (calculatedSignature === receivedSignature) {
      // Webhook request is authentic
    } else {
      // Webhook request is not authentic - handle accordingly (e.g., log error, reject request)
    }
    ```

* **Webhook Origin IP Whitelisting:**
    * Restrict webhook requests to specific IP addresses or ranges associated with Unitalk's servers.
    * Configure your server's firewall or web server to only accept webhook requests from these trusted IP addresses.
